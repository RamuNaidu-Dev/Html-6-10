<h3>Introduction:</h3>
Python is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">high-level</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">general-purpose programming language</a>.
Its design philosophy emphasizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming#Readability_of_source_code">code readability</a> with the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule">significant indentation</a>.

Python is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#DYNAMIC">dynamically typed</a> and garbage-collected. It supports multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">programming paradigms</a>, including structured (particularly procedural), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"> object-oriented </a> and functional programming.<br>It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library">standard library</a>.

<h3>History:</h3>
Python was invented in the late 1980s by <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" target="_self" title="Guido van Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a> at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language target="_self" title="ABC PL")">ABC programming language</a>, <br> which was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETL" target="_blank" title="SETL">SETL</a>, capable of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling" target="_self" title="exception handling">exception handling</a> and interfacing with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba_(operating_system)" target="_self" title="Amoeba">Amoeba</a> operating system.
Its implementation began in December 1989.

<h3>Design philosophy and features:</h3>
Python is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_multi-paradigm_programming_languages" target="_blank" title="multi-paradigm PL">multi-paradigm programming language</a>.<br>Object-oriented programming and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming" target="_blank" title="structured programming">structured programming</a> are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming" target="_blank" title="ascept oriented programming">aspect-oriented programming</a> (including metaprogramming and metaobjects).<br> Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.
Python uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#DYNAMIC" target="_blank" title="dynamic typing">dynamic typing</a> and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management" target="_blank" title="memory management">memory management</a>.<br>It uses dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_resolution_(programming_languages)" target="_blank" title="name resolution">name resolution (late binding)</a>, which binds method and variable names during program execution.
